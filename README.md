This repository contains the source code for the lending platform, including frontend files, backend contracts, and testing files.



## Description

The lending platform is designed to facilitate lending transactions between lenders and borrowers. It includes a frontend user interface implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The backend logic is implemented in a Solidity contract named `Backend.sol`, which provides functions for lenders and borrowers to interact with the platform. Additionally, the collateral token functionality is implemented in an ERC-20 contract named `CollateralToken.sol`.

For a visual demonstration of the lending platform, you can watch this **[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRF62IfZoIA)**.

## File Structure

The repository has the following files:

- `Testing files`: This directory contains the files used during the testing phase of our platform. These files are essential for ensuring the functionality and reliability of the lending platform.

- `FrontEnd`: This directory contains JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files that comprise the frontend of the lending platform. These files are responsible for creating an interactive user interface and enabling users to interact with the platform's features.

- `Backend.sol`: This Solidity contract file implements the backend logic of the lending platform. It contains the lender and borrower functions necessary for facilitating lending transactions.

- `CollateralToken.sol`: This Solidity contract file implements an ERC-20 contract for the collateral token functionality. It provides the necessary functionality for managing and transferring the collateral token within the lending platform.

- `UserManual.md`: This file provides a detailed guide on how to use the lending platform. It explains the various features, instructions for lenders and borrowers, and any additional information users may need to effectively navigate and utilize the platform.
