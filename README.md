# Repository Name

This repository contains the source code for the lending platform, including frontend files, backend contracts, and testing files.



## Description

The lending platform is designed to facilitate lending transactions between lenders and borrowers. It includes a frontend user interface implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The backend logic is implemented in a Solidity contract named `Backend.sol`, which provides functions for lenders and borrowers to interact with the platform. Additionally, the collateral token functionality is implemented in an ERC-20 contract named `CollateralToken.sol`.
